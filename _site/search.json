Dr. Gordon Wright is extremely proud to be working with, and mentoring, the current lab members. Students range from first year undergraduates to extremely impressive PhD researchers.\nThe lab is part of the Personality and Social Processes Research Group and its members study a range of fascinating behaviours using a distinctive range of methods. We try not to take ourselves too seriously and have plenty of fun doing what we do.\nSome current examples of the things we examine and projects on the go at the moment:\n\nThe cognitive, social and decision-making processes involved in deception and other antagonistic or antisocial everyday behaviours\nInterpersonal perception and cognitive perspective taking in ecological settings\nPredicting personality and future behaviour from limited information of differing types and predictive value\nWhat does it take to make someone break the rules? How personality influences cheating behaviours in a range of contexts\nThe Machiavellian in the Workplace. How much Mach gets you paid?\nIt’s only a lie if I say it is. How different deception strategies allow for self-justification of deceptive behaviours\nMy pants are on fire. The profiles of prolific and prodigious liars\n\n---\nDr. Gordon Wright’s recent consultancy projects:\n\nCustomer segmentation and propensity modelling for a traditional brand moving to online only sales\nTesting of recruitment advertising and linguistic analysis of applications for a financial services organisation\nHow to develop a more approachable customer service bot for a large communications company\n\nIf you would like to know more by joining our email list, please follow the link below\nEmail List Sign-up form\nor paste this link into your browser: http://eepurl.com/gBI-qz"
